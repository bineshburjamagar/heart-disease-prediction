    "### Predicting heart disease using machine learning\n",
    "This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease on their medical attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to take the following approach:\n",

    "In a statement,\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?\n",

    "### 2. Data\n",
    "The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease\n",

    "There is also a version of it available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data\n",

    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "> If w can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.\n",
